The "instances" folder represents the instances, and it contains three subfolders. For instance, "cust10" represents all the instances where each satellite serves 10 customers. The instances in the "cust 10" folder are named based on the number of city distribution centers, the number of satellites, the number of commodities, and the first/second/third/fourth test instance of this special scale.
